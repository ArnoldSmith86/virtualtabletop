# Joker cards

The original design of the two jokers cards (originally named `1J.svg` and `2J.svg`) are renamed as `3J.svg` and `4J.svg`.

The new design of the two joker card images (named `1J.svg`, `2J.svg`) is based [the joker cards](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Red_joker.svg) in Byron Knoll's "Playing cards set", which was [released into the public domain](http://byronknoll.blogspot.com/2011/03/vector-playing-cards.html) by the author.

Tsan-Kuang Lee made some adjustments (new layout to match others cards in this folder, and to improve visibility when cards are stacked with a narrow offset; converted the font to SVG paths for better compability). The new works are also released into the public domain.

# Additional card back image

`3B.svg` is [based on the image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Card_back_06.svg) from [David Bellot's sVG-cards](https://svg-cards.sourceforge.net), with a slight modification in sizing.
