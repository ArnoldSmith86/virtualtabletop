    "html": "VTT uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to create games. Game developers interact with VTT by creating widgets that consist of JSON expressed as various properties of widgets. The syntax for using JSON is very strict and a misplaced punctuation mark can make a widget invalid (in which case it will revert to its last previously valid state when using Edit Mode). Review this tutorial to understand that syntax and to know which punctuation marks to use and where. \n\nIf you use the buttons in the Edit Mode to add and delete properties and their values, then this is mostly automated. However, at some point in game development, you will start cutting and pasting or just directly typing. Inevitably you will start to see red text in the Editor indicating some syntax problem. Keep the principles in this tutorial in mind when trying to find the problem. Also remember that the Editor will try to identify the line number of the problem for you."
