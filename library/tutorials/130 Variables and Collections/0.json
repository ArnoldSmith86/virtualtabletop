Some variables are predefined by the VTT engine and are available in every routine. Most variables are created in a routine by a game designer. Those are only accessible while that particular routine is active and do not persist within the room or game after the routine ends. If you need that data for later, store it on a custom widget property. Variables can hold many types of data including numbers, strings, boolean and null values, arrays, and objects. For each button below, click on it and compare what you see in the JSON with what shows up in the debugger output."
