When activated, the dragging property value is the playerName of the player dragging the widget.

Examine the pin using the JSON Editor while dragging and dropping the pin."

The purple checker above changes the cursor to a hand when you mouse over it and when you drag it, the cursor changes to a grabbing hand. The blue circle is given a drop-shadow while dragging.  The blue circle also introduces the key .draggingSelf which changes the css, but only in a way that the playering doing the dragging can see. So when you drag the blue circle, all players see the drop-shadow, but only the dragging player sees the circle turn red."
