Almost everything that a game room designer can control about what the players see is done through JSON.  The JSON contains the properties of all the widgets (the collective name for anything appearing in a VirtualTabletop room).  The JSON also contains the functions that control automation and changes to widget properties through various 'Routines.'\n\nEvery widget is its own JSON element that must begin and end with curly brackets like this { }. Between the curly brackets will be various properties such as \"id,\" \"x,\" \"y,\" \"width,\" and \"height.\"  Many more properties are possible. Most widgets will contain size and position, but the only mandatory property is an \"id.\" Each property must be followed by a comma, except for the last one which must not have a comma.\n\nAs an example of what JSON looks like, the JSON for the widget that contains this text is: \n\n{\n\"id\": \"page1Text1\",\n\"parent\": \"hldPage1\",\n\"x\": 100,\n\"y\": 100,\n\"width\": 1400,\n\"height\": 800,\n\"z\": 2,\n\"movable\": false,\n\"css\": \"font-size:22px\",\n\"text\": \"This VirtualTableop.io room .....\"\n}"

If you use this method, you are on your own to get the commas and brackets correct.  It has very rudimentary error notification and will not allow you to save/update the widget if there are errors.\n\nFrom this mode:\n\n  - You have a link directly to the wiki\n\n  - You can click on the link to an \"advanced editor\" which is informally known as the Ghetto Editor. It still has its uses, but Ghetto is not being kept updated and current with all the changes in VirtualTabletop. Essentially all Ghetto Editor capabilities are now available in the JSON Editor.\n\n  - You can type directly into the text editor to change the JSON. When finished, click \"Update widget\" to save your changes. If you want to leave the edit mode without saving changes, press the Escape key.\n\n  - You can duplicate the widget or you can delete it by pressing the appropriate keys below the text editor window.\n\n  - This edit mode also has simple click-to-change capability allowing basic editing of game pieces, holders, buttons, timers, etc. that do not require interaction with the JSON code.\n\nThis editor is mainly useful for making very quick and easy edits. For example, if you just wanted to change the text in this text box, you could use this editor.\n\nPRACTICE: Right now go ahead and click on the edit mode icon.  Then click in the outlined area in the main part of the screen and it should bring up the edit menu you saw on the previous screen.  Practice making minor changes to the text, to the x,y coordinates, and the width and height. It's okay to save the changes so you can see them by pressing \"Update widget\" because you are just in the practice room. However, if you are in a room you actually are working on, be careful about making and saving changes. Be sure to read the FAQ to make sure you understand how the room is saved.  Simply making a change to the JSON will not save the current room state; that is a different process."

You should leave it open for the rest of this user guide, although you can close it at any time by again pressing CTRL-J. The room that you can interact with will be slightly smaller and shifted left on the screen to make room for the editor. Move the cursor towards the middle of the screen.  In the upper right side of the left column, the changing numbers show the x,y coordinates of the cursor position in the room.  As you get near the middle, hold down CTRL while left-clicking on your mouse.  That will select this text widget for display in the editor. When you press the green arrow to change to the next page, the JSON editor will still display this item (the last one that you selected for display).",

Others will only be displayed if they are not null.\n\nYou can edit the JSON by typing directly into the property or value.\n\nPRACTICE.  Go ahead right now and try typing some additional text into the large green block of text that makes up this widget.  Remember, to select this widget (you are probably still on the one from the previous page), put the mouse somewhere near the middle of the screen and CTRL-click.  You can also change the x and y values for the position of this block of text and see instantly how it changes.  Change the width value from 1400 to 400 and back to see the effect of that change.\n\nBe careful making changes, however.  Changes take effect immediately and there is a very, very limited undo capability.\n\nUsing CTRL-click to select a widget is one way to display the JSON of a widget.  Another way, and one that is required if widgets overlap, is to use the function keys. As you move the cursor around the screen, look towards the top of the screen for the white text on a black background. When the cursor is over an area with a widget, this area of the screen will show its id, its type and the function key you use to access it.  For example, if you move the mouse over the orange back button, you will something that looks like the picture below.\n\nPRACTICE.  Move the cursor around the screen over the various areas with text or images.  Press the corresponding function key to see the JSON for that widget."

This part of the JSON editor is context sensitive, meaning that you will get a different display based on where your cursor is placed in the JSON. For this image, the cursor was placed on the first \"LABEL\" function inside of the \"clickRoutine.\"\n\nGenerally, the menu will display the most specific to the most general.  You can get an idea of where you are in the hierarchy of the JSON by looking at the small white text with arrows.  For example, at the very top, you see button ↦ clickRoutine ↦ 5 ↦ (IF) ↦ elseRoutine ↦ 4 ↦ (LABEL) ↦ mode.  This means the cursor is located in a button type of widget, inside of a clickRoutine, at the 6th function inside the routine (counting starts at 0) which is an IF function. It is further located within an elseRoutine, at the 5th function which is a LABEL and at this point you can change the mode property by clicking on one of the blue buttons.\n\nAlthough you can press any of the buttons that are available to you, the location that the property or function is inserted will depend on where the cursor is and what level in the hierarchy the property applies to.  For example, if you were to press the \"color\" button, it would not be inserted into the code at the point of the cursor, but at the appropriate place for that property.\n\nAt the bottom of the options will be a button to remove the current function, property, etc.. While you can use the keyboard to add or remove items, using these buttons helps put the right commas, brackets, and other items where they belong.\n\nPRACTICE. Use the JSON editor to select the button below. It contains the same clickRoutine as the green arrow, so if you click it, you will advance to the next page. Practice adding and removing items into the code using the editor."

This is usually because what you told it to do is not what you thought you told it to do.           \n\nThis button should rotate these four pawns 180 degrees, but only the last one is rotating. Look at \"Original and applied operation\" in the debugger to see what the code is actually doing and what you could do to fix it.  The explanation of the ROTATE function from the wiki is shown below for reference.      \n\nThe \"Original and applied operation\" will show you the operation as it appears in your code, and the operation as it gets processed, which has any variables filled in by their current values.  It also shows the default values of arguments that you did not specify when you called the function. Looking at the \"Variables and collections afterwards\" can also help you see what is going on."

You can also use Ctrl and right click. Also, if there are multiple widgets under the cursor, you can select which one(s) you want by pressing Shift and the F1, F2, etc. function key for the corresponding widget. You can practice this now on the checkers below.\n\nThere are two other ways to specify multiple widgets. Once you activate multi-select mode, you will see a temporary new 'property' at the very top of the middle vertical column called 'widgets.' It will list the id of each selected widget. The first additonal way involves typing in the id of the desired widget using the same array format you see displayed. You can also delete individual widgets from the multi-select grouping by removing their ids from the 'widgets' array.\n\nThe other additional way is by using a JavaScript style regular expression. The expression will search the id field of all widgets in the room and add those that match. For example, the checkers below have ids of crown1, crown2, nocrown1, nocrown2. If you want to select all the widgets that include 'crown' in their name, add the following RegEx to the 'widgets' array: '/crown/' It should look like the image below.\n\nWhen looking at the properties of the multi-selected widgets, they will be grouped together as you see below. For example, all the x coordinates are listed in a group with the specific x coordinate for each widget identified. If the selected widgets all have the same value, then there will only be one entry.  For example, all the checkers are on layer 3.  If you want to change the value for all of the checkers at the same time, just change the 3 to the desired value. You can also add a new property by clicking on the blue 'add property' button.  Just type the name of the property in the textbox that appears and press 'Go.' Do not use quotations and do not enter the property value.  The property will be created with a value of null and then you just change null to the desired value for all selected widgets.",

    "text": "The multi-select mode also has context-sensitive options for aligning and distributing widgets in the room. To use this mode, multi-select the desired widgets (in this example, you will be using the 4 checkers below). Then move the cursor to the x or y coordinate.  This will bring up new options in the far-right vertical column that look like the image below.\n\nClick the 'align' button to bring up a menu with two drop-down options. The 'Coordinate' options are Center, Top/Left, Bottom/Right. If you select 'Top/Left' then the x or y coordinate of all widgets will be changed to the x (or y) coordinate based on what you choose as the 'Reference' option.  The 'Reference' options are First selected widget, Lowest value, Highest value, Center of all. Play around with the options to see how these work. Move the checkers around to different starting positions in the room to see how that changes things. Press the blue reset button to return the checkers to their original starting positions.\n\nAfter selecting multiple widgets, put the cursor in the x or y coordinate line.  Then press the 'distribute' button. This will instantly equalize the spacing between the selected widgets. Again, you can experiment with the checkers below.\n\nThis concludes the user guide.
