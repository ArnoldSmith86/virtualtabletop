      "ruleText": "Roll 4 dice. Divide the dice into pairs and sum the pips. At most, there are 3 possible combinations. Pick a pair of sums that correspond to a column of the same number on the board. For each sum in the pair, if you have one of your 3 climbers remaining, you must enter it onto the board if you can.<div><ul><li>If you have a marker in that column, enter the climber onto the space above the marker.</li><li>If you do not have a marker in that column, enter the climber in the lowest space in that column.</li><li>If you already have a climber in that column, do not enter another climber but instead move the existing climber up one space in that column.</li></ul><div>Repeat for the other sum of the pair. If the pair is a double (for example, 7 and 7), then either move the existing climber up two spaces, or enter a climber into the column (at the bottom or above the marker) and then move it up one more space.</div><div><br></div><div>After rolling the dice, so long as any single die allows a climber to be advanced or entered, you must do so. Then you can choose whether to consolidate your gains or press your luck.</div><div><ul><li>If you consolidate your gains, replace each climber with a marker and return the climbers to your pool. When it is your turn, roll the dice again and start the process over, but entering climbers one space above existing markers.</li><li>If none of your dice allow a legal play, then your turn is over. All the climbers are returned to your pool. When it is your turn, roll the dice again and start the process over.</li></ul><div>When a player gets a marker (not a climber) in the top space in a column, that column is closed. Return all other climbers and markers in that column to the players.</div></div><div><br></div><div>The first to claim the designated number of columns wins the game. The default is 3, but any value between 1 and 11 can be chosen in the settings.&nbsp; The game works best with no more than 4 players, but this online version allows up to 6. If you have more than 4 players, you should consider making the number of columns needed to win either 2 or 1.</div><div><br></div><div>This online version of the game also has several variations of the timing of turns.</div><div><ul><li><b>Traditional</b>. Each player completes their turn in sequence. A turn ends only when a player fails to make a roll that allows a legal play or when the player decides to stop and consolidate the gains.</li><li><b>Simultaneous turns</b>. All players roll dice and make selections at the same time. Players can keep playing as long as they press their luck until either they fail to make a roll that allows a legal play or they decide to stop. Once all players have failed or stopped, a turn button appears at the top of the screen.&nbsp; Press that to begin the next round.</li><li><b>Lightning</b>. This mode is a complete free-for-all.&nbsp; Players can play without any regard for turns or rounds. The first to reach the top of the designated number of columns wins.</li></ul></div></div>",

Used at the beginning of the game. Click to choose a seat and pick a color. Click again to change color, get up from seat, or force another player to get up from seat.

The climbers (bi-color squares) are used to indicate the level that a player is currently pursuing based on the roll of the dice in the current turn. There are 3 climbers per player. When a player ends the turn to lock in the gains, the climbers are replaced by markers on the board.

Once a player has entered climber(s) onto the board, the player must decide whether to keep rolling or end the turn. Pressing this button ends the turn.
