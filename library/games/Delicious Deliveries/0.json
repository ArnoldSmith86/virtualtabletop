      "ruleText": "GAME OBJECTIVE:\nPlayers will build the city, eventually owning one shop of each of the four goods (boardgames, donuts, fish, and sandwiches). The player's score for each good is the number of road spaces that must be traversed for a hypothetical delivery truck to travel from the supply of that good (yellow and depicting trucks as well as the good) to the player's shop of that good (green and depicting only the good). A player's final score will be the total of their four scores for the goods, minus any remaining cash from their starting $15. The lowest score wins the game, having delivered the freshest goods to their customers.\n\nPLAYER TURNS:\nEither place an ownership cube on an unowned, unoccupied plot of land or draw a tile from the deck and resolve it. A player with no unoccupied owned plots of land (marked with their cube) on the board cannot draw a tile and must place a cube instead. A player with no available cubes in their supply cannot place a cube and must draw a tile instead.\n\nPLACING A CUBE:\nPlace your ownership cube on an unoccupied, unowned plot of land that is either: (a) next to an owned but unoccupied plot of land (of any player); or (b) next to a road. For both purposes, only count ordinal compass-point adjacency and not diagonals.\n\nOn each player's first turn of the game they may place in any unoccupied, unowned space on the entire board, and are not required to satisfy either of the requirements (a) and (b) above.\n\nDRAWING A TILE:\nDraw the top tile from the deck and proceed based on whether it is a shop (green tile depicting one of the four goods) or a neutral building (showing some skyscrapers).\n\nDRAWING A SHOP:\nAn auction takes place for this shop. All players who do not already have a shop for this good take part in the auction. The auction is a blind bid auction where all players commit an amount between $0 and their total remaining cash. All bids are revealed simultaneously and the highest bid wins the shop and pays their bid. In the case of a tie, resolve favouring the tied player closest in turn order to the current player - i.e. the current player wins ties, followed by the player after them in turn order, etc.\n\nAfter winning the auction and paying their winning bid, the victorious player places the shop under one of their existing ownership cubes on an unoccupied space on the board. This may cause roads to be placed - see below. The player who won the auction immediately moves one of their reserve cubes - if there are any still remaining - into their available supply.\n\nIf the auction was not won by the current player, the current player immediately takes another turn.\n\nDRAWING A NEUTRAL BUILDING:\nThe current player places the neutral building on an unoccupied space currently containing their player cube, and takes that cube back into their supply. This may cause roads to be placed - see below.\n\nPLACING ROADS:\nImmediately after setting up the game and after every tile (either a neutral building or a shop) is placed onto the board, check to see if any new roads need to be placed and place them where necessary. If a road needs to be placed in a space where a player has a player cube, that cube is returned to them without compensation and the road is placed.\n\nRoads must be placed to ensure that at all times these conditions are met:\n1. All roads and all unoccupied spaces on the board will connect into a single network by the end of the game - there can be only one road network; and\n2. Every shop and every supply has road access on at least one of its four ordinal, compass-point sides.\n\nEND GAME AND SCORING:\nWhen the tile deck is exhausted, the game ends immediately. Fill all unoccupied spaces on the board with roads (or simply treat them as if roads were present for final scoring). Total up player scores and the player with the lowest score wins.\n\nEach player's score is calculated by summing up their travel distance for each of the four goods, then deducting their remaining cash.\n\nThe travel distance for each good is calculated by counting the number of road tiles that need to be traversed to travel from the delivery source to the player's shop. For each good, this distance is capped at a maximum based on player count: 14 in a 5-player game, 12 in a 4-player game, 10 in a 3-player game, and 8 in a 2-player game.",
      "helpText": "SET UP:\nHave all players take a seat and then press the New Game button, selecting the desired set-up in the window that appears. This will pick the appropriately-sized board, set up the initial goods supplies, and populate the correct number of roads and other tiles in the relevant stacks. Players should then immediately place any roads required for this set up as per the game rules.\n\nAUCTIONS:\nPress the Start Auction button to hide all players' Bid banknotes from each other. You can click on your Bid banknote to change your bid - when you submit a bid your Ready marker next to your Bid banknote will be updated to show you are ready. You can toggle it back by clicking on it if you need to rethink your bid.\n\nOnce all players have bid, the current player can press End Auction to reveal totals. The auction winner should press the Pay button to pay their winning bid from their available cash.\n\nCORRECTING MISTAKES:\nIf a player who did not win the auction accidentally pays their bid, they can correct this by clicking their Bid banknote, making a corresponding negative bid, and then clicking Pay.\n\nEND GAME SCORING:\nPress the 'Score' button to toggle the display of a scoreboard that can be used to tally up final scores. When you click to display the scoreboard, cash scores will be entered automatically. Click on the other cells to enter the other parts of each player's score.",
