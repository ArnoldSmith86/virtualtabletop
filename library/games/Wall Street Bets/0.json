      "helpText": "Have all players take a seat and then click the Setup button to create a random board and pick a start player.\n\nThe pawn is the only player component which should be dragged and dropped - to take most other actions in the game you should instead use the buttons in the player areas and in the central company areal.\n\nThe implementation will allow you to sell all of your shares of a company - this is helpful in bankruptcy and end-game situations as described below. However, recall that you are not allowed to sell your final share if nobody else owns a share of that company.\n\nSpecific situations:\n• COMPANY SPACE: Either: (A) pay 50 (or 100 if price is in the high-price green area of the market) to the fund using the \"50 → FUND\" button in your player area, then click the company spinner; or (B) click the fund spinner and resolve the result.\n• RECEIVE THE WHOLE FUND: When rolling the Fund die and getting a Raid result, you take the entire contents of the fund. Click the \"50 ← FUND\" button in the relevant player area until there is nothing left in the fund.\n• EVENT SPACE, SWAP STOCK: Use the small circle buttons in the player area to exchange one stock for another. Use the button below the Buy/Sell buttons of the share you want to give, and click the button with the colour/suit of the share you want to receive.\n• BANKRUPTCY: Reduce the company's price to zero and then have all players sell their shares with their Sell buttons. (They will receive no money as the price is zero.) Then increase the price back to 100.\n• END GAME: Have the player moving the pawn to the Goal space take up to $100 from the fund by clicking the \"50 ← FUND\" button in their player area twice. Then click the End Game button and confirm you're happy to end the game. This will sell all shares at once, after which the player with the most cash then wins the game.\n• FIXING MISTAKES: If you accidentally take or give money to the fund, or accidentally buy or sell shares, you can usually reverse this by doing the opposite. (You may need another player to buy and/or sell a share too in order to get the presidency in the right place.) if you accidentally pay dividends or take money from the bank when you should not have, then you can undo this by manually adjusting players' cash totals - click on the large dollar bills to bring up the UI to edit their value.",

      "ruleText": "GAME OBJECTIVE\nHave the most net worth (value of your shares at their current price, plus your cash in hand) once the purple pawn has traveled around the whole track around the edge of the board and reached the \"Goal\" space.\n\nCOMPANIES\nThere are four companies which a player may invest in: Red ♥, Green ♣, Blue ♠ and Yellow ♦. Each of these companies can increase or decrease in share value over the course of the game and can pay dividends to shareholders, allowing you the chance to make more money than your opponents.\n\nPRESIDENT\nThe first player to buy a share in a company becomes its President. From then on, if another player overtakes them in share count (either because of buying more shares than the President, or because the President sells shares), that player becomes the President.\n\nUnless it goes bankrupt (see below), a company must always have a President once someone buys the first share. Therefore, if you are the only share-holder, you may not sell your final share.\n\nPLAYER TURN\nOn the first turn during the game, each player either Trades Stocks or chooses to skip their turn. On every subsequent turn, a player must Move the Pawn and may also Trade Stocks. If they Trade Stocks, this may be done either before they Move the Pawn or afterwards, but not both.\n\nTRADE STOCKS\nA player buys and sells as many shares as they like/can afford at the current share price. No player may own more than 12 stocks in total. There are 15 stocks available in each company and more can be purchased if they are all owned by players.\n\nMOVE THE PAWN\nEvery turn except each player's first, the pawn must be moved and the space it lands on resolved. In a 2-player or 3-player game, the pawn is moved 1, 2, 3 or 4 spaces. In a 4-player or 5-player game, it is moved 1, 2, or 3 spaces.\n\nThe \"Goal\" space may not be passed over, and the game will end once this space is reached and resolved.\n\nCOMPANY SPACES\nThe spaces marked with the colour and symbol of one of the companies give the president of that company an opportunity to operate their company or attempt to raid the fund. In the case of the space marked with all four company colours and symbols, the player taking their turn and moving the pawn picks one company and the space is resolved as if it had only that colour and symbol.\n\nOPERATING OR RAIDING\nWhen the company's colour space is resolved, the President (not necessarily the player whose turn it is) makes a decision. Either they pay $50 (or $100 instead if the company in question is in the green area at the top of the stock price chart) into the communal Fund on the board in order to operate the company, or they attempt to raid the contents of the fund.\n\nOPERATING A COMPANY\nAfter paying $50 (or $100 if the company's price is high enough) into the Fund, the President spins the company spinner and resolves the effects. \"Price +1\", \"Price -1\", \"Price +2\" etc. refer to the spinning company and adjust it the relevant number of spaces on the stock price chart. Prices can go down as well as up. \"Div\" indicates that dividends are paid - at a rate-per-share corresponding to the current stock price as looked up on the stock price chart. \"Other\" value changes apply to any company other than the rolling company.\n\nATTEMPTING TO RAID THE FUND\nIf the president cannot or chooses not to pay into the fund to operate the company, they must attempt to raid the fund. They spin the black spinner and resolve the effects: \"Status Quo\" indicates nothing happens whilst on the other results the price will be reduced by one or two steps and the raiding president will take the entire cash contents of the Fund on the board.\n\nHIGH-PRICE DIVIDEND SPACE\nWhen landing on the space with a picture of a graph and a money bag marked \"Dividend\", the company or companies with the single highest price at the time on the stock price chart immediately pays dividends to all share holders. As with the \"Div\" spinner result, the rate-per-share is determined by looking up the corresponding figure in the Dividend column on the stock price chart, based on the company's current share price.\n\nEVENT SPACE\nWhen landing on the Event space, the player taking their turn spins the white Event spinner and resolves the result shown.\n\nPRESIDENTS' SPACE\nWhen landing on the space with the crown and \"X100\" symbols, $100 is paid from the bank to the player that holds each company President title at present. The same player could potentially receive multiple $100 payments if they hold multiple company President titles.\n\nGOAL SPACE\nWhen landing on the goal space, the player taking their turn receives $100 from the Fund on the board (or the whole fund, if it contains less than $100) and then the game ends. All shares are sold for their current share price and the player with the most cash then wins the game.\n\nCOMPANY BANKRUPTCY\nIf at any point during play, a company's share price would fall down into or beyond the Bankrupt space at the bottom of the share price chart, the company goes bankrupt. All shares are returned to the bank for no compensation. There is then again no President, just as at the beginning of the game. The company's share price is returned to the starting value of $100 and it may be re-launched by a player who buys the first share (and becomes President) during any subsequent turn's stock trading.",
