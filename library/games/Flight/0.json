      "helpText": "Players sit in seat. Press Start button in bottom-right corner and select from the options to begin. A random player is chosen to begin. Drag and drop cards, food, eggs, and action cubes on to the main player mat as needed. To tuck a bird card, just drop it in the holder. Once you tuck a card, those cards and pile become unmovable for the remainder of the game so that scoring routines work properly.\n\nYou can view other players' mats and food tokens (but not cards) by pressing on the eye icon below each seat. The small text below the seat shows which player's mat that seat is viewing. Viewing another seat prevents you out from taking most other actions except changing the view again. When looking at another seat, clicking anywhere on the board will automatically return the view to your own mat.\n\nPlace dice removed from the birdfeeder in the area above the 3 common bird cards and the used dice can be rolled as a group by pressing the roll button. The refill button will recall and roll all 5 dice. The discard holder in the bottom-right corner can be used for both bird cards and bonus cards.\n\nAt the end of a round, drag an action cube for each player to the green or blue end-of-round board. Once the correct number of cubes are placed into holders on that board, the button to start the next round will display in the bottom-right corner.\n\nScorekeeping is automatic in all rounds except in round 4, players must calculate and enter their own scores for bonus cards. Use the + and - buttons that display at the end of round 4.\n\nThe bird icon near the seat indicates the starting player. During a round, you can change the glow indicator on the seat by pressing the turn button in the bottom-right corner. This will also refill the common cards holder with 3 cards if needed. At the end of each round, the bird icon will advance to the next player automatically.\n\nFor solo mode, sit in the far left seat (seat #1). The automa cards and other objects are at the top of the screen. The automa uses maroon action cubes. Place the cubes on the goal cards for the current round. At the end of the round, move one of the cubes into the green (or blue) end-of-round goal scoring cards just like you move your own cube. For the automa, use the end-of-round goal card that covers the scoresheet for seats 3-5. Eggs should be placed in the small holder below the maroon action cubes. All scoring for the automa is automatically calculated.\n\nThe automa's actions are not automated. You must manually move cards and other objects in accordance with the rules. At the beginning of each round, the automa's action cards will be set up for the round, but during each turn, you must flip over a new card.",
