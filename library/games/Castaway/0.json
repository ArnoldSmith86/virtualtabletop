      "ruleText": "Players sit in seats. Click the Restart button to randomly select a player to begin and to set the number of sailors based on the player count (five sailors for 3-4 players and four sailors for 5-6 players).<div><br></div><div><b>Objective</b></div><div><br></div><div>Score the most points by getting crewmembers across the board to the safety of the island. There are 3 islands at the top of the board. Each island shows two numbers such as \"8/6.\" The first number is the points awarded for each officer that makes it to the island. Officers are two-toned tokens with a dark shaded symbol. The second number is the points awarded for each sailor that makes it to the island. Sailors are single-colored tokens with a light shaded symbol.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Voting and Negotiations</b></div><div><br></div><div>All decisions are made by majority vote. When a player is ready to vote, click on the blue Vote button and select an icon. The icons represent the color of the boat or player the voter wishes to select for that phase. In addition to the 6 player colors and the icon for the black boat, the player may also play one of their 3 captain cards represented by a black exclamation mark on a white card.</div><div><br></div><div>Once a player has started voting, a text label will appear above the seat indicating the player is \"Voting.\" Once the player has completed the vote, the label will change to \"Ready\". Once all players have voted, one player should click the \"Show\" button. This will reveal all the votes at the same time. Any time after the vote and before the next vote, press the \"Hide\" button to erase the vote icons.</div><div><br></div><div>Players are encouraged to negotiate with each other before voting, but any deals made are not binding.</div><div><br></div><div>If only one player uses a captain card, that player can overrule the vote and decide the outcome. If more than one player uses a captain card, they all cancel out and only the remaining votes are counted. Once used in a vote, a captain card is out of the game even if the player did not get to benefit from using it.</div><div><br></div><div>In the event of a tie, the starting player for that round breaks the tie even if that player would not get to vote under the rules.</div><div><br></div><div>As an optional rule to speed up the game, the starting player for that round may declare negotiations over at any time and call for a vote.</div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Set Up</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>The starting player drags their boat and places it into the bottom row (closest to the bottom) in any column. Moving clockwise (from left to right in the room), each player does the same with their own boat. Then the first player places the black boat into the bottom row of any open column.</div><div><br></div><div>The starting player places one crewmember (sailor or officer) into any open seat on any boat. Continue clockwise (left to right) until all crewmembers have been placed into boats.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Rounds</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>The game is played in multiple rounds consisting of the same 3 phases. Repeat the process until all boats are safely at an island or have sunk. Rotate the starting player by using the Turn button between each round.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Phase 1: Leak</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>After negotiations, vote for a boat to spring a leak. If there is a seat on the boat that does not contain a crewmember or a leak, add a blue water droplet leak token to a seat in the boat.</div><div><br></div><div>If there are no empty seats, players with crewmembers in the boat negotiate and then vote to determine who is thrown overboard. Each sailors gets one vote, and each officer gets two votes. The losing player must remove a sailor from the boat if there is a sailor and remove an officer only if there are no sailors. Remove the eliminated crewmember from the board by returning it to the holder by the seat. Place a leak token in the vacant seat.</div><div><br></div><div><u>Check</u>: After placing a leak token, count the leaks and crewmembers on the boat. If the boat has more leaks then crew, it sinks and the crew and the boat are removed from play.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Phase 2: Move</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>After negotiations, vote for a boat to move one space up the board closer to the islands. If a boat reaches the fourth row (nearest the island) the crew on the boat are put on the island for later point calculations and the boat is removed from play (drag it back to the invisible holder just above the seat of the same color).</div><div><br></div><div>If only one boat remains, it automatically moves forward one space without a vote.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Phase 3: Swim</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Beginning with the starting player for the round and moving clockwise, each player removes a crewmember from a boat and places it behind that boat in the water. Only one crewmember can leave each boat. This means some players may not remove anyone.</div><div><br></div><div>Starting with the last player and then returning to the starting player in reverse order, each player puts their swimming crewmember into a different boat than the one it left. Crewmembers can only join a boat with an open seat (one that is not occupied by other crewmembers or leak tokens).</div><div><br></div><div>Multiple players may get into the same boat if there is room. If there is no room in an eligible boat, the crewmember drowns and is removed from the game.</div><div><br></div><div>If only one boat remains, this phase is skipped.</div><div><br></div><div><u>Check</u>: After all crewmembers have been added to boats or drowned and removed from play, check each boat. If a boat has more leaks than crew, it sinks and the crew and the boat are removed from play.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Repeat</b></div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>After Phase 3, rotate the turn to the next player clockwise and start over with Phase 1. Continue this cycle until all boats are safe or sunk.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Scoring</b></div><div><br></div><div>At the end of play, calculate scores based on the officers and sailors on each island. The first number on the island is the points per officer and the second number is the points per sailor.</div>",
