Everyone will secretly bid any amount they want (up to the amount they have in their hand), and then simultaneously reveal. The winner of the auction is whoever bid the most money but they will ONLY pay the amount bid by the second highest bidder. Example: If player A bids 10, player B bids 15, and player C bids 50, player C wins the auction, but only pays 15. All other players do not spend any money.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><br><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span><span>NOTE: In the event of a tie in the auction, only the tied players will participate in a second auction round. The bids in the second round must be as high as the bids in the first round. If this still results in a tie then a third auction occurs, again the starting bid amount is determined by the highest bid in the second round and so on. If nobody increases their bid, it is randomly determined who amongst the tied bidders wins the property and they pay the bid to the bank.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span><span>If nobody makes a bid for a property, then a second auction round occurs. If there is still no bid in the second round, then the property goes to someone randomly for free. If anyone bids any amount while every other player bids 0, then the winning player would win while paying 0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><br><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span><span>Once an auction is won, the winner has to decide if they will place a house or a tree in the designated spot. If they place a house, they can potentially earn more money while the game is being played. If they place a tree, they have the potential to earn a big bonus at the end of the game. The decision to place a house or tree is solely for the auction winner BUT the other players can bribe the winner to place something in the way they prefer. For example, Player A and Player B might offer 5 points each to Player C to place a tree in an area. Player C might counter with a request of 15 points total, and players A and B could accept or renegotiate. Once a house or tree has been placed, it cannot be changed.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span><span>There are 4 corner districts around the edge of the board. Yellow district is A1, A2, B1, and B2, light green is A3, A4, B3, and B4, red-orange is C1, C2, D1, D2, and blue is C3, C4, D3, and D4. There is also a central district that is B2, B3, C2, and C3. Houses or trees placed in these central districts affect their assigned corner district as well as the central district.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span><span>When a house is placed, check to see if there are any trees in the district it was just placed in. If there are, the player who placed the house earns 10 points per tree in that district. If a tree is placed, all houses in the district earn 10 points for their owners. Example, if player A places a tree in a district where they own 2 houses and player B owns 1 house, then player A scores 20 points, and player B scores 10 points. As a further example, if the board was set up as such: A1: player 1 house, A2: Player 1 house, B1, player 2 house and newly placed tree was in B2, then all the house in the upper left corner district would score for the tree AND all the houses in the central district of B2, B3, C2, and C4 would score for that tree.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span><span>Houses can also earn you a bonus points throughout the game if you satisfy these conditions.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span><span>Condition 1: you have placed a house in each of the 4 corner districts.

Keep in mind, it doesn’t matter if another player has trees in that district, it only matters if you’re the only one with a house in the district. This also earns you 20 points immediately. This bonus can be granted in each corner district to any player, including the same player who previously scored this bonus in another district.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><span><span>After the 16th auction round is complete, reveal your scores and determine if you get any bonuses for preserving nature. First, calculate how many trees have been played in the game. Review the table at the top of the screen to determine what this bonus will entail. Then, determine who has the most and second most trees. First place gets the top score, 2nd place gets the bottom score. If multiple players tie for first, add the first and second place scores together and divide equally amongst the players (rounding down). No points are awared for second place in this scenario. If multiple players tie for second place, divide the second place points equally, rounding down. For example: player A has placed 3 trees, Player B has placed 2 trees, and player C has placed none. Total trees on the board equal 5, which means that 1st place of 40 points goes to Player A, second place of 20 points goes to player B.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><div><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\"><br></span></div></span></div>",
